*Basic version of React Redux to do app
*This could be improved by adding UI Components for buttons, text input field, toggle show hide completed 
*Some more unit tests need to be added for toggleItem in list component
*Few more unit tests needed for todos.js toggleItem, toggleList etc
*Styling can be improved as well
